# Introduction to C/C++ and Memory Concepts

A beginner-friendly project to explore C/C++ programming, memory architecture, and compiler basics.

## Features
- Demonstrates C/C++ syntax with variables and pointers.
- Explains physical memory addresses and RAM.
- Shows memory segments (stack, heap).
- Illustrates the compilerâ€™s role in code translation.
- Explores byte-level memory usage for data types.

## Files
- `memory_intro.cpp`: Main C++ program with detailed comments.
- `test_memory_intro.sh`: Bash script to compile and test the program.

## Setup
1. Ensure `g++` is installed: `sudo apt install g++`.
2. Run the test script: `bash test_memory_intro.sh`.
